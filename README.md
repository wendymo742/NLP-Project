This is a team project working on analyzing the helpful information in book reviews via Natural Language Processing tools. We collect datasets with book reviews written by both professionals and also normal customers. By analyzing each kind of reviews and also performing the comparison, we try to answer the question what kind of information is useful as a review for the customers.
We have TF-IDF methods ans K-means as our baseline model. And then, we implement BERT, Fine-tuned BERT and also Sentence-BERT for better text representation and clustering.
Although the result is not as ideal as we originally thought, there are still some meaningful insights. 
More improvement can be done by collecting datasets that are better-matched.
